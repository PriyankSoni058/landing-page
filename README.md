Here is the full code for the `README.md` file, which includes instructions on how to install dependencies, run the development server, and deploy the Next.js application:

```markdown
# Next.js Application

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project tailwind css and redux with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
yarn install

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the app.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page will automatically update as you edit the file.

This command builds the application for production, optimizing it for deployment.

- **Start the server in production mode:**

```bash
yarn dev
```
